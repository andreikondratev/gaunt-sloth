/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 * BATCH-32 — **tool coverage**: which of the tools the agent actually advertised to the model a
 * suite exercised, and which it never touched.
 *
 * The numerator has existed since GS2-16 (`runStats.tools`, per cell, already in every
 * `<case>.json`). What was missing is the DENOMINATOR: a run that calls 3 of 41 advertised tools
 * prints the same all-green summary as one that calls all 41, so "every cell passed" reads as
 * reassurance it has not earned, and coverage decays silently as the server grows a 42nd tool
 * nobody wrote a case for.
 *
 * Pure and dependency-free on purpose (the `classificationReport.ts` precedent): every input is
 * handed in, so the whole facility is unit-testable without an agent, an MCP server or a model.
 *
 * ## The denominator is the FULL advertised list, and that is the design decision here
 *
 * The list the agent binds is narrowed by `allowedTools` before it is bound. Taking the denominator
 * from the narrowed list would let any suite reach 100% by narrowing the allow-list to the tools it
 * already calls — the tools nobody exercises would leave the bottom of the fraction instead of being
 * named. So the denominator is the pre-filter inventory, and the removed tools are reported as their
 * own {@link ToolCoverageReport.filteredOut} category.
 *
 * ## What "covered" means, stated in the output rather than assumed
 *
 * A tool counts as covered when it was **called**. A call whose result came back an error still
 * counts: the tool was reached, which is what a coverage figure measures. Grading what a tool
 * RETURNED is what `must_error` / `tool_result_json_path` assertions are for, and they are a
 * different question asked per case.
