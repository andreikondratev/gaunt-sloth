/**
 * BATCH-21 tool-RESULT assertions — grade a cell against what its called tools *returned*
 * (`toolResults`: per-call `isError` + payload), not just which names were called (BATCH-10's
 * `#src/toolChecks.js`) or what the answer said. This is the structural check the authz/data-
 * isolation suites need: "the restricted identity CALLED the tool AND the call came back denied"
 * becomes deterministic instead of judge-graded.
 *
 * Kept beside (not inside) `runToolCallChecks` on purpose — same file-per-input-kind split the
 * answer checks use: these read the tool RESULTS, that one reads the tool NAMES. Name patterns
 * reuse the same `toolNameMatchesPattern` glob/exact matcher (`@gaunt-sloth/core`), so
 * `mcp__unimarket__*` selects results exactly as it selects calls in `must_call`; payload paths
 * reuse `resolveJsonPath`, the same minimal dot/`[index]` evaluator `json_path` uses on the answer.
 *
 * - `mustError` — for **each** pattern, at least one tool result whose name matches it has
 *   `isError: true`, else `tool "<pattern>" did not return an error` (the same single message
 *   whether the tool succeeded or was never called — either way, no matching error came back).
 * - `toolResultJsonPath` — each entry passes iff **at least one** result from a tool matching its
 *   `tool` pattern satisfies it: the payload parses as JSON, the `path` resolves, and (when set)
 *   `equals` deep-equals / `contains` substring-matches the resolved value. A non-JSON (or absent)
 *   payload is a deterministic per-result FAIL, never a throw. A payload capture cut at
 *   `toolResultCaptureMaxBytes` fails too, with its own reason naming that key, even when the
 *   cut prefix still parses — the cut is recorded on the result at capture (`contentTruncated`),
 *   and this check reads that record rather than inferring the cut from the stored length or from
 *   a parse of the prefix.
 *   (BATCH-43) The payload it reads is the result's `errorPayload` when capture recovered one — an
 *   errored MCP tool's own error body, freed from the adapter's prose prefix — and otherwise the
 *   observed `content`, which is left exactly as the model saw it in either case.
 *
 * The runner only ever calls this with expectation blocks a `gth-agent` suite produced — the suite
 * parser rejects tool-result assertions against `ag-ui`/`adk-agent` targets, whose wire carries no
 * result payloads (see `#src/evalSuite.js`), so an empty `toolResults` here means "no tool
 * returned anything", not "the target can't report results".
