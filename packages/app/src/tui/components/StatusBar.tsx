 * width-conditional, and a rule that only exists inside a React render can only be tested by
 * driving a terminal. `columns` is a parameter rather than a `useStdout()` read for the same
 * reason `ApprovalStopMessage` takes one.
 *
 * ## Why the PROVIDER is the half that goes
 *
 * This is the one surface where `model (provider)` has a real cost: a single line already carrying
 * the mode, a turn counter, an approvals badge and sometimes a debug hint, all competing for the
 * terminal's width. Every other surface in this node renders into a block that can afford the
 * extra columns; this one cannot, so it is the one place a width-conditional omission is right.
 *
 * When the full line does not fit, the **provider** is dropped and the model is kept — never the
 * other way round, and neither is ever truncated. The model is the more informative half (it is
 * what the user chose), and a clipped `openrou…` or `claude-sonnet-4…` is misleading rather than
 * merely terse, which is the same reason the launch banner DROPS a version it cannot fit instead
 * of clipping it. Dropping the provider costs the disambiguation this node adds; clipping either
 * half would cost correctness.
 *
 * Below the budget the segments still exceed the row if the bare model alone is too wide. This
 * function only guarantees that ADDING the provider cannot be what pushes the line over; what
 * happens to a row the bare segments themselves overflow is `statusBarRow`'s and the render's.

 * informative first:
 *
 * 1. the provider — `statusBarSegments`'s decision, with the badge reserved and the debug hint
 *    NOT reserved, so the same width arithmetic makes every step;
 * 2. the rater profile on the badge — `approvals: Assisted (auto-rater)` becomes
 *    `approvals: Assisted`;
 * 3. the debug hint, when it is drawn: it gets only the room the segments and the badge leave it
 *    — clipped with `…`, or not drawn at all (`hintAsDrawn`) — and neither step above reserves a
 *    cell for it, so it is the first thing on the row to give way at every rung, before the
 *    profile and before the provider. It is the least informative element there, and this step
 *    is arithmetic because a layout engine cannot put one sibling first;
 * 4. only then truncation with `…` at the row's end, which is the RENDER's: every `<Text>` on the
 *    row is `wrap="truncate-end"`, and exactly one part of the row refuses to shrink. At every
 *    rung but `bypass` that part is the segments, and the badge gives way first. At `bypass` it is
 *    the badge, and the segments' tail gives way instead: `⚡ Bypass` is the one badge whose
 *    absence misreports a posture with no gate at all, so it holds whole while `ready`, then the
 *    turn counter and — below the width that holds mode + model + the `…` the clipped segments
 *    end in + badge — the model itself are clipped. That step is by construction rather than by
 *    arithmetic, which is what makes the one-row count true at a width narrower than the segments
 *    themselves.
 *
 * So the row's priority, highest first: the badge (`bypass` only) → the model → the rest of the
 * segments → the badge (every other rung) → the hint.
 *
 * So the strings returned here can still be wider than the row together; what this function
 * promises is that the least is sacrificed that the arithmetic can tell will fit, and that the
 * choice is made here, in a pure function a spec can drive, not in JSX.
