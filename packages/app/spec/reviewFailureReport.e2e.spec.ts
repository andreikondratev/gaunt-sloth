/**
 * REL-20 — process-level e2e proving that a review which fails BEFORE inference still writes the
 * report file `writeOutputToFile` promised.
 *
 * Why spawned CLIs rather than unit assertions: the defect is that no file exists on disk. It was
 * never a missing `displayError` call — the error was reported perfectly well, to a terminal
 * nobody was reading, while the next CI step died on `ENOENT ... 'review.md'`. An assertion about
 * which console helper was called cannot see that, which is why the bug survived a suite that
 * already covered these error paths.
 *
 * **Both entry points are exercised from one file on purpose.** `gth pr` / `gth review` and the
 * standalone `gaunt-sloth-review` bin have separate catches and cannot share a spec cell, and the
 * requirement on them is that they do not diverge — so their cells sit side by side, driven by one
 * config and one stub, where a divergence shows up as one red cell next to a green one.
 *
 * The failure is the real one from the issue: a stub `gh` on PATH exits non-zero with GitHub's
 * verbatim HTTP 406 for a pull request over the 300-file diff limit. That message names the limit
 * and both ways around it, so what the report must carry is the source's own text rather than a
 * summary of it. The stub is written twice — an extensionless shebang script POSIX shells execute,
 * and a `.cmd` that Windows resolves through PATHEXT — because this suite has a Windows cell.
 *
 * Hermetic and key-free: the `fake` provider replays a canned answer for the cells that reach
 * inference, and HOME/USERPROFILE point at an empty temp dir so an ambient `~/.gsloth` config
 * cannot decide the outcome. Requires the build — `pnpm test` builds before vitest runs.
