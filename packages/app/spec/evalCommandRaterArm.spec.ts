/**
 * [[BATCH-31]] — **the note-on / note-off A/B, driven the way a user drives it: one suite file
 * through `gth eval`.**
 *
 * The other two specs for this facility hold the ends of the route. `raterPromptArm.spec.ts` holds
 * the batch end (parse, expand, arm, reconcile) and `raterPromptNotesNotSuppressible.spec.ts` in
 * core holds the production end (a session's gate cannot be told to drop a note). **This one holds
 * the link between them** — the hand-off in `evalCommand.ts` that takes the expanded cell's arm and
 * passes it to `buildRaterClassifier`. Nothing else asserts on that line, and a facility wired to
 * nothing is a facility that measures nothing: severing the hand-off leaves both other specs green
 * while every cell of every arm sends the identical prompt, and the suite reports the note changing
 * nothing. That is the false negative this file exists to catch.
 *
 * So the run here is as real as a unit spec can make it: the real suite parser, the real sweep
 * expansion, the real per-cell merge of `cell.config` in `initConfigForCell`, the real
 * `buildRaterClassifier`, the real `rateShellCommand` and the real `buildRaterPrompt` — mocked at
 * the MODEL, which records the messages it is asked to invoke, and at `initConfig`, which is
 * replaced argument-blind so no user config is read. That last mock is why the claim above is about
 * the MERGE and not about config construction: what a cell's `config:` does to a resolved config is
 * exercised (the rung control below sweeps one), what `initConfig` itself does with the merged
 * overrides is not. What is asserted on is the string that reached the model.
