/**
 * REL-24 (a) — process-level e2e proving that a review which fails INSIDE the agent exits non-zero.
 *
 * The sibling file `reviewFailureReport.e2e.spec.ts` covers the opposite condition: a run that
 * fails BEFORE inference. Those exits already set the code; this one did not. `review()`'s runner
 * catch reported the provider error perfectly well and then returned normally, so the process
 * drained with exit 0.
 *
 * **Why that has to be a spawned process.** The defect is a property of the process, not of a
 * function call: the console output was already correct, and a mock cannot observe an exit code at
 * all. `_review-shared.yml` keys its "Check review step result" step on the review step's OUTCOME,
 * so a review that exited 0 posted a failure comment on a run CI called green — the same failure
 * the console said had happened.
 *
 * **The induced failure is a real provider error and needs no key and no network.** The config
 * points the Ollama client at `127.0.0.1:1`, a port nothing can be listening on (privileged, so
 * nothing binds it unprivileged, and this is loopback either way), and the call comes back as a
 * connection failure in about a second. An explicit `baseUrl` in the `llm` block beats both
 * `OLLAMA_HOST` and the local default, so a developer running a real Ollama daemon gets the same
 * refusal as a CI runner with none. The assertions read the exit code and gaunt-sloth's own
 * `Failed to run review with agent.` line rather than the socket error's text, which is spelled
 * differently per platform.
 *
 * Requires the build — these cells spawn `packages/app/cli.js` and `packages/review/cli.js`, so
 * `pnpm test` (which builds) is the entry point; a bare `pnpm run unit` tests the previous `dist`.
