/**
 * REL-20 — the belt to the product fix's braces: the review workflow must not die on a missing
 * `review.md`.
 *
 * `gaunt-sloth-review` now writes the report even when the run ends before inference, so the
 * ordinary failure arrives at the comment step as a file that explains itself. This guard covers
 * what is left — a run that produced no file at all — and it matters because of WHERE the crash
 * lands without it: `github-script` throws `ENOENT ... 'review.md'` from a step several removed
 * from the one that failed, so the run reports a missing file instead of the reason there is one.
 *
 * Both halves are asserted, because dropping the file is only half a fix. The run must still FAIL,
 * and it does through "Check review step result", which fails on the review step's own outcome —
 * a result worth reading, unlike the ENOENT. A guard added without that step still standing would
 * turn a failed review into a green build, which is strictly worse than the crash.
 *
 * Asserted against the workflow text: nothing executes this file in the unit suite, nothing
 * type-checks it, and no code path references it, so a refactor can drop either half with no
 * signal at all. Same reasoning as `core/spec/docsRenderGateWired.spec.ts`.
