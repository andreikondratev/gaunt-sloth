/**
 * [[TUI-C27]] — **what the approvals gate DID, recorded while it was doing it**, for the
 * `/debug-dump` archive.
 *
 * ## The two gaps this exists to close
 *
 * 1. **An approval used to leave no trace at all.** A rejection is legible in a dump only as a
 *    byproduct of the negotiation — the protocol has to hand the reason back to the agent, so it
 *    lands in the transcript. An approval relays nothing to anyone: the tool simply runs. So the
 *    archive was at its most detailed about the decisions that STOPPED something and silent about
 *    the one decision that let something happen, which is exactly backwards for an incident review.
 *    Everything here is written on both branches.
 * 2. **Every field anyone had was a rater OUTPUT; its INPUT was never recorded.** Rung, outcome,
 *    reason, which preflight, whether the floor fired — all of them describe what the rater
 *    *answered*, and none records what it was *shown*. The question that actually failed in the
 *    field — *"were the user's messages in view on round 2?"* — needs the input of an approving
 *    round, the one combination the dump had neither half of.
 *
 * ## The one rule that shapes the whole module: CAPTURE, NEVER RE-RENDER
 *
 * {@link RaterCallCapture.prompt} holds the exact `{system, user}` strings handed to the model, taken
 * inside `rateShellCommand` at the send site — not rebuilt afterwards from the state that produced
 * them. A dump that can disagree with what actually happened is worse than no dump: it invites a
 * confident wrong conclusion from the only evidence there is, which is the failure mode this node
 * was filed over. The same rule is why {@link RaterCallCapture.rawResponse} keeps the model's answer
 * *before* it is mapped to an outcome — a malformed or surprising answer stays visible rather than
 * being smoothed into a verdict.
 *
 * ## The records are pushed EARLY and mutated in place, deliberately
 *
 * {@link ApprovalCaptureLog.begin} appends the record the moment a gated call arrives, and the gate
 * fills fields in as they are decided. The alternative — assemble the whole record, push it at the
 * end — loses exactly the events worth keeping: an `attack` verdict throws `AttackHaltError` out of
 * the decision, so a run that halted would carry no record of the rating that halted it. Pushing
 * first makes survival a property of the structure rather than of someone remembering to write the
 * record before each `throw`.
 *
 * ## Redaction
 *
 * Nothing is redacted here. The archive writer routes this artifact through the SAME
 * [[GS2-47]]/[[GS2-54]] pass as `transcript.json` and `model-messages.json`
 * (`renderStructured` → `redactText`, over the literal secret values `collectSecretValues`
 * harvested from env + config). Redacting twice, in two places, is how two policies come to exist.

 * - `hardline-floor` — §8's deterministic floor matched, before any rating or prompt.
 * - `escalate-entry` — a declared `approvals.escalate` entry; a human answers, with no rating call.
 * - `allow-list` — an allow entry settled it with no rating (`rate: false`, or an unrated rung).
 * - `allow-tripwire` — an allow entry that kept the rater involved (§3.2's `rate: true`).
 * - `rater` — the ordinary rating path.
 * - `tool-open-world-floor` — §4.7.3's floor on a non-shell call whose effective `openWorldHint`
 *   is true. No rater sees it while §4.3's scope boundary stands.
 * - `unrated-rung` — nothing but the rung itself: `manual` and `write` consult no model, so a call
 *   no rule claimed goes to the human on the rung's say-so. It is its own value rather than an
 *   absent one, because "the rung requires a person" is an answer and a blank field reads as the

 * would assert what the wire cannot establish. Collapsing it with `no-human` would tell an incident
 * review that a prompt nobody ever saw and a prompt that was put in front of somebody are the same
 * event.
 *
 * `unrecognised` ([[EXT-193]]) is the third non-answer: something came back from the surface, and
 * this build could not read it — a protocol client choosing an option id we never offered, or
 * answering in a dialect that postdates this code. It is not `teardown`, which says the prompt
 * ended with nobody's answer on it; it is not `no-human`, which says nobody was asked; and above

 * fix is not four corrected literals: four sites in one class can be funnelled through one helper
 * without restructuring the record, so they are, and the field is `readonly` so that a fifth site
 * cannot be written any other way.
 *
 * ## Why the argument is the surface's reply
 *
 * "A person answered" is not something the gate can observe; it can only be told. So the parameter
 * is the value the surface handed back — the whole of it, mapped here — and there is no overload
 * that takes an {@link ApprovalHumanAnswer} directly. A caller that wants to record *reject* has
