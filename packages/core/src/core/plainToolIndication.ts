/**
 * @module plainToolIndication
 * TUI-C30 — compact tool-call indication for the PLAIN surface (`--no-tui` readline sessions,
 * piped/single-shot `ask`/`exec`/`review`/`pr`). The Ink TUI renders tool calls from the typed
 * event stream; the plain surface streams strings, so until now a tool call only surfaced
 * through the tools' own transient notices (`📁 Reading file: …`, `🔧 Executing …` + raw child
 * output via the tool-output channel's default sink). This module watches the SAME LangGraph
 * message stream the string path already iterates and, when each `ToolMessage` lands, prints
 * one compact indication built from the shared {@link toolDisplay} registry:
 *
 *     ✓ 📁 read_file(path=README.md)
 *         # Readme            ← up to the canonical 10 preview lines, dim
 *         … (+42 more lines)
 *
 * Stream discipline (matches how the plain surface prints tool activity today): the block goes out
 * through `displayToolIndication` — same stdout channel, same `consoleLevel` gate and session-log
 * treatment as the existing tool notices. **The level it is gated at is the call's OUTCOME, not
 * this call site** (`TOOL_STATUS_LEVEL` below), so a quieted console keeps the failures — and a
 * successful row outranks the INFO chatter announcing the same call, so silencing that chatter
 * does not silence the row. Colour is used exactly when the resolved `useColour` (the CFG-30
 * ladder in `config/colour.ts`) says so — TUI-C35 removed the
 * local `&& stdout.isTTY` narrowing this module used to apply on top, which was redundant against
 * the ladder's own rung-4 TTY auto-detection everywhere except `FORCE_COLOR` on a pipe, the one
 * case that variable exists to serve. An ordinary piped run is therefore still clean monochrome
 * (DL-7) — rung 4 decides that — with diff lines readable via their `+`/`-` prefixes.
 *
 * Live-output dedupe: shell-shaped results (`<COMMAND_OUTPUT>`) belong to tools whose child
 * output ALREADY streamed raw via the channel's default sink, so those render with
 * `liveOutputAlreadyShown` and show only the closing status line — never a repeat of output
 * the user just watched.

/**
 * [[TUI-C108]] — **how loud a finished tool call is, decided by how it ENDED.**
 *
 * Keying the level on the tone is what makes the outcome expressible at all: a level fixed at the
 * call site forces every `consoleLevel` rung that hides a success to hide a failure with it, so
 * "tell me when a tool BROKE" lands on no setting.
 *
 * [[TUI-C109]] — **`success` sits at DISPLAY, one rung above the chatter announcing the same
 * call.** The status row is the line that names the tool and carries its arguments
 * (`✓ 📁 read_file(path=README.md)`), so it is the one line per call worth keeping once a run is
 * quieted; `Requested tools:` and `Thinking...` are INFO and drop away beneath it. That is what
 * `consoleLevel: "display"` is asked for, and paired with `toolOutputPreviewLines: 0` it is
 * exactly one line per tool call.
 *
 * Outcome-levelling survives that raise because `warn` and `error` stay strictly louder: every
 * rung that keeps a success keeps a failure too, and `warning` and above still keep the failures
 * alone. The row is the reporter's kept line; it is not a return to one level for every outcome.
 *
 * It reads off {@link toolStatusDisplay}'s tone rather than re-deriving from `isError`, so the
 * level cannot disagree with the glyph and words printed beside it — including the case where a
 * rater clarification outranks an error status, which is a WARNING here precisely because §5.4
 * says it is not a failure.
 *
 * `warn` sits at WARNING rather than ERROR so that a `consoleLevel: "error"` session — someone who
 * asked for failures only — is not shown a negotiation round that is still in progress.

 * is [[TUI-C106]]: an approval-gated call is announced in the stream that suspends at the gate and

 * `ToolMessage` arrives, mirroring `processEventStream`'s reset-per-round). Deliberately does
 * NOT `concat()` whole `AIMessageChunk`s: only the tool-call slices are needed, which also
 * sidesteps the TUI-C29 `__raw_response` aggregation-growth trap entirely.
 *
 * `emit` is injectable for tests; production uses `displayToolIndication`, which gates on the
