 *
 * The extraction is deliberately structural and defensive (duck-typed reads guarded by a
 * try/catch) rather than `instanceof`-based: the same accumulator serves both the non-streaming
 * `invoke` path (a full `messages[]` from graph state) and the streaming paths (individual
 * message chunks / `ToolMessage`s as they arrive), across providers whose message shapes vary.
 * Nothing here may throw into a run — a missing/odd field just means that datum is skipped.

 * about it said "8 KB" — exact only for ASCII, and a different size from the one the code cut at
 * the moment a payload contained a character outside the ASCII range. Measuring UTF-8 bytes is what
 * those sentences already claimed, and it is the unit both neighbouring caps
 * (`builtInTools.<tool>.maxOutputBytes` / `maxBytes`) already use, so one number now means one size
 * to the person setting it and to the code applying it. An ASCII payload behaves exactly as it did
 * at this default; a non-ASCII one is cut somewhat earlier, which is the size the docs promised.
 *
 * This constant is the default's single source. A configured `toolResultCaptureMaxBytes` overrides
 * it at the read site (`resolveToolResultCaptureMaxBytes`); nothing else may restate the number.

 * - **The capture must be what the MODEL observed.** That is the one property a tool-result trace

 * - **No shape is unreachable, so nothing is being worked around.** `resolveJsonPath` normalizes
 *   `[0]` index syntax, so a block reachable at `text` in the object form is reachable at `[0].text`
 *   in the array form; a bare-string payload parses directly.
 * - **Unwrapping would silently break suites already written to the documented `text` hop**, and it
 *   would make the capture depend on which MCP-adapter branch produced the content (a lone text
 *   block arrives as a bare string, but as a block object once the server also returns
 *   `structuredContent`/`_meta`) — swapping a stated contract for an inferred one.
 * - It would not help the case this capture exists for anyway: a SOFTENED MCP error's payload is
