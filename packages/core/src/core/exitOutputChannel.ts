/**
 * TUI-C56 — the queue for output that must OUTLIVE the session's own screen.
 *
 * TUI-C48 put the whole interactive session in the terminal's alternate screen. Ink treats
 * alternate-screen teardown output as disposable by design: on unmount it restores the primary
 * buffer without replaying prior frames, so everything the session painted — every notice, every
 * answer — goes with the alternate buffer when the session ends. That is exactly what the
 * full-screen surface is for, and it is the right default for a conversation.
 *
 * It is the wrong default for the handful of things a user must still have AFTER the session:
 * a path they now have to go and open. The first of those is the `/debug-dump` archive, whose
 * in-frame notice is genuinely useful mid-session and completely gone the moment the user exits —
 * leaving them holding a diagnostic bundle they cannot find, with nothing having errored.
 *
 * So this is a channel, not a special case: a producer anywhere in the codebase can DEFER one
 * block of text, and the surface that owns the terminal drains it once the terminal is its
 * owner's again. Two halves, deliberately split:
 *
 * - **This module is the queue and nothing else.** No stream, no formatting, no policy about
 *   when a line is worth printing. That keeps it surface-agnostic and directly testable.
 * - **The surface owns the write.** Only the surface knows when its terminal is back (for the
 *   Ink TUI: after `waitUntilExit()` has resolved, which is after Ink has left the alternate
 *   screen) and whether writing is appropriate at all (a piped run must not get an extra line
 *   its caller did not ask for). See `writeDeferredExitOutput` in the TUI session module.
 *
 * A surface whose output already survives its own exit — the readline (`--no-tui`) session, which
 * never owned an alternate screen — simply never drains. Deferring is then a no-op that costs one
 * array entry and prints nothing, which is what keeps the producers surface-agnostic: `/debug-dump`
 * is one command with one behaviour, and the two surfaces differ only in whether the re-print is
 * needed at all.
