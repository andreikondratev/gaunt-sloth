/**
 * @module core/mcpErrorPayload
 *
 * BATCH-43 — recover the **server's own error body** from the prose-wrapped message
 * `@langchain/mcp-adapters` throws for an MCP tool result carrying `isError: true`, so
 * `gth eval`'s `tool_result_json_path` can grade *what a denial said* and not merely that one
 * happened.
 *
 * ## Why there is anything to recover at all
 *
 * The MCP spec treats a tool-execution error as a normal result the client SHOULD hand back to the
 * model. The adapter instead throws, and the throw discards everything structured:
 *
 *     if (result.isError) throw new ToolException(
 *       `MCP tool '${toolName}' on server '${serverName}' returned an error: ` +
 *       result.content.map((c) => c.type === 'text' ? c.text : '').join('\n'));
 *
 * `result.structuredContent` and `result._meta` are read only on the lines *after* that throw, so a
 * server that puts its error detail solely in `structuredContent` is unreachable from here — that
 * is upstream, not a gap this module can close. What survives is the flattened **text** content,
 * behind a fixed prose prefix. Recovering it is therefore a matter of removing exactly that prefix.
 *
 * ## The prefix is COMPUTED, never matched
 *
 * The alternative — hunt the message for something that looks like JSON — needs a rule for which
 * JSON is *the* JSON when a message contains several, and a heuristic like that has no business in
 * a deterministic grading path: its failure mode is a plausible wrong parse that the suite author
 * cannot see. Every variable in the adapter's template is one we already hold, so the exact
 * expected prefix can be built and stripped, which dissolves the question instead of answering it.
 * When the constructed prefix is not what the message starts with, **nothing is recovered and no
 * field is recorded** — an absent field and the check's existing "not JSON" reason are an honest
 * answer; a lucky substring is not.
 *
 * Because the prefix is an upstream template literal, a dependency bump that rewords it would
 * silently stop the field ever being recorded while every other test stayed green (the observed
 * payload is untouched either way). `packages/agent/spec/mcpAdapterErrorMessage.spec.ts` therefore
 * drives the real adapter against a real in-memory MCP server and compares its thrown message to
 * {@link mcpToolErrorMessagePrefix}'s output, so such a bump reds here first.
 *
 * ## The server name is RESOLVED, never split off the registered name
 *
 * The adapter's template names the server by its `mcpServers` key and the tool by its **bare**
 * name, while the registered name the model calls is `mcp__<server>__<tool>`. A configured key may
 * itself contain `__`, so splitting the registered name on the separator attributes the call to a
 * shorter key that also happens to be configured — and the prefix built from it would be wrong in
 * exactly the case a multi-word server name makes likely. Resolution goes through
 * {@link approvalSubjectForToolName}, which scans the configured keys, so a recovered payload and
 * an approvals decision can never disagree about which server a tool belongs to. A name that
 * resolves to {@link UNRESOLVED_MCP_SERVER} (nothing matched, or two nested keys both did) yields
 * no field: there is no server name to build a prefix from, and guessing one is the thing this
 * refuses to do.
 *
 * ## Why this lives at the CAPTURE site, not at the softening middleware
 *
 * The softening middleware in `GthLangChainAgent` holds the same two variables, and BATCH-43's
 * ruling names it as the place where they are available. Deriving there would mean carrying the
 * result to the capture site on the `ToolMessage` itself — a new field on the one object whose
 * fidelity to "what the model observed" is the whole reason the trace is graded. That object is
 * serialised by nine provider conversion paths and by the checkpointer, and none of them is a hop
 * this change should have to defend. The registered tool name and the content are identical at
 * both sites, so the derivation is the same computation either way; done here it needs no new
 * field on a message and reuses the middleware → `accumulateMessage` hop BATCH-23 already proved.

/**
 * The server's own error body, recovered from a softened MCP tool error, or `undefined`.
 *
 * **Present implies parseable**, and that contract is the point: the grading check falls back to
 * the observed payload — and to its existing failure reason — whenever this returns `undefined`, so
 * a recorded field must never be something the check would then choke on. Every one of these
 * yields `undefined`:
 *
 * - the result is not an error, or its content is not a plain string (a blocks array is a SUCCESS
 *   shape; the adapter's throw always produces a string);
 * - the name is not MCP-namespaced, or does not resolve to exactly one configured server;
 * - the message does not start with the computed prefix (a different adapter message — an invalid
 *   result, an unexpected content type — or an upstream reword);
 * - the remainder is not JSON, which is simply a server that formats its errors as prose;
 * - the remainder is longer than `maxLength`.
 *
 * That last one is a deliberate choice rather than a fallout. The observed payload is capped at
 * capture so a giant result cannot bloat run stats, and the same bound has to apply here or the
 * cap is trivially escaped. But a JSON document cut off at the bound does not parse, so recording
 * a truncated one would spend the bytes, break the present-implies-parseable contract, and leave
 * the check failing anyway — while looking, to whoever reads the record, as though the recovery
 * had worked. Dropping it says the true thing instead.
 *
 * @param result The captured result: registered name, error status, and the untouched content.
 * @param configuredMcpServers `Object.keys(config.mcpServers)` — the user's own keys, and the only
 *   thing consulted when resolving which server this tool belongs to.
 * @param maxLength The same cap the observed payload is held to.
