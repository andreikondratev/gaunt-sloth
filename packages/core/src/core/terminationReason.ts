/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 * EXT-159 — the typed reason a run ended.
 *
 * A run can stop for a dozen unrelated causes — a rate limit, a provider-side fault, a full context
 * window, a content-policy refusal, the approvals gate, a tool-error budget, the user pressing Esc
 * — and every one of them used to reach the surface as one untyped sentence. This module is the
 * single taxonomy those causes are classified into, so the fact "why did this end" is carried as a
 * value rather than reconstructed from prose.
 *
 * **Two feeders converge here, and they are not interchangeable.**
 *
 * - A **metadata reader** (`detectStopMetadata` in `core/refusal.ts`, called from
 *   `GthAbstractAgent`) handles reasons that arrive *on a message* — a stop/finish reason in
 *   `response_metadata` or
 *   `additional_kwargs`. It sits at that layer because that is the only place the metadata is
 *   visible.
 * - An **exception classifier** ({@link classifyThrownTermination}, called from the runner's
 *   catches) handles reasons that arrive as a *thrown error*. Those are not in `response_metadata`
 *   at all, so no metadata reader can ever see them.
 *
 * Built as one metadata reader the whole thrown-error half of the class falls outside it; built as
 * two taxonomies every consumer grows its own. Hence: two feeders, one taxonomy.
 *
 * **Retryability is two facts, never a boolean.** `@langchain/core` exports a typed
 * `ContextOverflowError` that stamps itself non-retryable in its own constructor. That is right for
 * "send the same prompt again" and exactly backwards for the remedy this cause actually has, which
 * is to send a *smaller* one. {@link GthTerminationReason} therefore carries
 * {@link GthTerminationReason#retryableAsIs} and
 * {@link GthTerminationReason#retryableAfterRemedy} separately, with the remedy named.
 *
 * Classification only. Nothing here surfaces anything, formats anything, or changes what a run
 * does; the user-facing strings stay where they are and keep their own wording.

/**
 * The single posture table.
 *
 * One place decides what a category means for retrying, so the three consumers this taxonomy exists
 * for — a retry posture, a "never retry a 400, a 429 is a different case" ruling, a nudge-or-back-off
 * decision — read the same answer instead of each deriving its own.
 *
 * ## THIS TABLE IS ADVISORY. `GTH_MAX_RETRIES` IS THE ENFORCEMENT.
 *
 * Read that before using a row to predict what the runtime will do. The table's job is to let this
 * project *explain* a termination — it is what turns a category into a user-facing sentence such as
 * "Sending the same request again may work", and what a remedy-aware caller consults before
 * deciding whether a changed request is worth sending. It is not consulted by anything that
 * actually re-sends a request.
 *
 * The retry loop lives upstream, in `@langchain/core`'s `AsyncCaller`, which decides retryability
 * from the error it caught — a response status, a rate-limit classification, a transport match —
 * with no knowledge of this taxonomy. What this project owns there is the ceiling: one stated count
 * (`core/retryPolicy.ts`), passed to every model we construct.
 *
 * ### Why it is left advisory rather than made to drive the retry
 *
 * Driving the decision from this table would mean owning the retry loop: intercepting each failure
 * before upstream's handler, mapping it to a category, and re-implementing backoff, `retry-after`
 * honouring and concurrency. That is a large replacement of working upstream machinery, and the
 * argument for it is weak, because **the two classifications already agree**. Measured against the
 * installed `AsyncCaller`: the statuses it refuses to retry are the `invalid_request` / `auth_failed`
 * rows; it splits a 429 into quota-exhausted (stop) and wait/capacity (retry after a delay), which
 * is the `rate_limited` row's back-off; and everything else, transport and provider faults included,
 * falls through to be retried — the `network_error`, `provider_error` and `timeout` rows.
 *
 * So one layer describes the posture and another enforces a count, and they do not contradict each
 * other. The honest move is to say which is which here, rather than to leave a reader inferring that
 * editing a row changes what gets re-sent. **Editing a row changes what the user is TOLD, not what
 * the runtime DOES.** A change to what it does is a change to the count, or an upstream change.
 *
 * ### The two places they do not agree, both upstream and both narrowing
 *
 * `ECONNABORTED` is rethrown by upstream's failed-attempt handler rather than retried, so a
 * connection aborted mid-request contradicts the `network_error` row; and transport is recognised by
 * matching the error message against a fixed list of literals, so a wording change upstream would
 * silently reclassify it. Both are recorded in full on `GTH_MAX_RETRIES`. Neither is reachable from
 * this file — they are named here only so a reader comparing the row to observed behaviour finds the
 * explanation instead of assuming the row is wrong.

  //
  // **Nothing structural can carry it.** `code: 400` and `status: 'INVALID_ARGUMENT'` are byte for
  // byte what a rejected API key returns from the same endpoint, so the prose is the only carrier —

  //
  // **The arm is the tail of the sentence rather than its head, deliberately.** 'input token count

  // rendered inline — `The input token count (1246756) exceeds the maximum …` — a gap the head

  // `The input token count exceeds the maximum number of tokens allowed 1048576.` against AI

  // would have missed Vertex entirely. Confirmed on both curated Vertex defaults
  // (`gemini-3.8-flash`, `gemini-3.5-flash-lite`) and on both transports.
  //
  // The one Vertex case this cannot reach is `gemini-2.5-flash-image` while STREAMING, which
  // answers an oversized input `Request contains an invalid argument.` with no token-count prose
  // anywhere in the body. Neither prose nor structure can close it — `code: 400` /
  // `status: 'INVALID_ARGUMENT'` are byte for byte a rejected key — and matching 'invalid
  // argument' would make every malformed request an overflow. [[EXT-176]] carries it; a negative
  // control in `googleContextOverflow.spec.ts` pins it until then.

 * read at all. The site that attached it watched the failure happen, and this module's whole
 * premise is that the message is not the carrier — so a feeder that reads the message anyway
 * exempts itself from the rule it states for every consumer.
 *
 * The exemption was user-visible. A message is the one part of an error that untrusted data reaches:
 * the binary-attachment middleware interpolates a **filename** into a provider rejection so the user
 * can see which file was refused, and `api-timeout-investigation.pdf` or `contract - terminated.pdf`
 * then read back out of the prose as a timeout or a dropped connection. Both are retryable postures,
 * so the user is told to send again a request the provider will refuse identically every time, and a
 * name matching an overflow pattern sends the runner off to compact the history first. Sanitising
 * the text against the pattern lists would only enumerate today's patterns and go stale the next
 * time one grows; preferring the committed value cannot go stale, because it does not depend on what
 * the text says.
 *
 * **Everything below is the fallback for a value nobody classified**, and it is unchanged. Order
 * still matters there. The typed and named cases are decided first, because a context overflow is
 * also an HTTP 400 and an abort is also a `DOMException`; only once those are excluded does the
 * status code and then the prose get a say.
 *
 * **The prose arms stay ahead of the invalid-request arm, and `status === 400` stays behind them.**
 * 400 is a bucket rather than a cause — providers put a bad API key, an expired grant and an
 * exhausted quota in it — so the specific arms are what recover the cause, and each of the
 * categories they recover names a remedy `invalid_request` has none of. Lifting the status above
 * them would trade `auth_failed` and its `fix-credentials` for a category that offers the user
 * nothing, and it would not close the hazard either: any permutation of a substring matcher leaves
 * some hostile substring that flips some category. Untrusted text reaching the matcher at all is the
 * defect, and the committed reason is what closes it.
 *
 * Never throws: an unclassifiable value is `unknown`, which is a recorded fact rather than a guess.
