 *   routinely run on — and the diff, the requirements and the model's own answer still have to fit

 * - a `string` → shorthand for `{ path }`;
 * - `enabled: false` → the segment is dropped entirely (returns `''`), even its bundled default;
 * - `path` + `mode: 'replace'` (default) → the file replaces the built-in segment content;
 * - `path` + `mode: 'append'` → the file content is appended after the built-in content.
 *
 * CFG-70 — and then the run's selected path-scoped overlays are appended, for every one of the
 * seven segments and therefore for every caller. This is the seam because it is the sole reader of
 * `config.prompts?.[segment]`: `readGuidelines`, `readReviewInstructions`, `readSystemPrompt`,
 * `readChatPrompt`, `readCodePrompt`, `readExecPrompt` and `readBackstory` are all thin wrappers,
 * so one edit here reaches `buildSystemMessages`, `getReviewPreamble` and the `gth get
 * system-prompt` introspection alike, with no site left to forget.
 *
 * **The scoped overlay survives `enabled: false`, deliberately.** A disabled root segment plus
 * matched scoped entries composes to the module blocks ALONE. Read against `enabled`'s own
 * docstring above — "the segment is dropped entirely" — that looks like a bug, and it is not:
 * `enabled` turns off the *repository-wide* segment, which is a coherent and useful monorepo
 * config alongside `prompts.paths` ("no guidelines for the repo, only per-module ones"). Honouring
 * it the other way would silently discard entries the user wrote explicitly, and force that user
 * to point `guidelines` at an empty file to express what they already expressed. Never discarding
 * configuration someone wrote on purpose is the principle the whole feature is built on.
 *
 * **`.filter(Boolean)` is load-bearing, not tidiness.** With no scoped entries selected — which is
 * every run today, and every run of a project that does not use the feature — all four branches
 * must compose byte-identically to what they composed before this existed. A plain
 * `[base, scoped].join('\n')` appends a trailing newline when `scoped` is empty; the filter is
 * what makes the unset path an exact identity rather than an almost-identity.
