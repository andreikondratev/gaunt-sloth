/**
 * OPS-98 — the hand-written release notes must stay wired into the release job.
 *
 * scripts/release-notes-for.mjs is unit-tested next door, but a script nothing invokes is the
 * failure mode that looks exactly like success: the Release page would go back to a list of merged
 * pull requests and every test would stay green. The helper reaches the release through strings in
 * a workflow file — a `run:` line and two `gh release create` invocations — none of which is
 * type-checked, executed by the unit suite, or referenced from any code path. That is the same
 * "preserved by nothing" problem docsRenderGateWired.spec.ts exists to solve for `docs:check`.
 *
 * Three properties are asserted beyond "the script is called", because each is a way this change
 * could break a release rather than merely undo itself:
 *
 *  - the `gh release view` skip stays, so a re-dispatch after a failed publish does not die;
 *  - a version with no notes file gets an EMPTY body, stated explicitly with `--notes ""`, and
 *    nothing synthesises one for it. `--generate-notes` would fill the page with merged pull
 *    requests, which here describe whatever happened to open one rather than the release — blank
 *    says nothing, that list says something untrue. The empty body is spelled out rather than left
 *    implicit so the step does not depend on `gh` deciding it cannot prompt;
 *  - the run block interpolates no `${{ }}` expression. An expression is spliced into the script as
 *    TEXT before bash parses it, and a release note title may contain a backtick
 *    (release-notes/v1_2_0.md) — which would then run as command substitution inside the release
 *    job. Values reach the block through `env:` instead, where an expanded variable is never
 *    rescanned. A green run cannot review that property; only this can.
 *
 * This asserts facts about the *files*. What the helper itself does is proven by running it, in
 * releaseNotesFor.spec.ts.
