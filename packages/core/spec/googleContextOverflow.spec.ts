/**
 * [[EXT-162]] — **Gemini's context overflow, pinned to the bytes Google actually sends.**
 *
 * `@langchain/google` maps no context overflow: it defines `GoogleError`, `RequestError` and
 * friends, and stamps `ContextOverflowError` on nothing. So an oversized input reaches
 * `classifyThrownTermination` as the package's own `RequestError` — an HTTP 400, thrown, never a
 * 200 with an error body. Recorded live on 2026-09-12 against AI Studio through
 * `@langchain/google` 0.2.3, on two models with different windows (`gemini-3.8-flash`, 1048576
 * tokens, and `gemini-2.5-flash-image`, 32768). The whole body is:
 *
 *     {"error":{"code":400,
 *               "message":"The input token count exceeds the maximum number of tokens allowed (1048576).",
 *               "status":"INVALID_ARGUMENT"}}
 *
 * **Nothing structural is available to classify it.** `code: 400` and `status: 'INVALID_ARGUMENT'`
 * are byte for byte what a rejected API key returns from the same endpoint — that body is recorded
 * below as a control — so the prose is the only carrier, and the arm
 * `'exceeds the maximum number of tokens allowed'` in `CONTEXT_OVERFLOW_PATTERNS` is the only thing
 * that classifies a Gemini overflow. Before it existed the 400 classified as `invalid_request`,
 * whose remedy is not `reduce-context`, so the [[EXT-160]] compact-and-retry seam never saw it.
 *
 * **The two halves of this node are not in the same state, and the cells reflect that.** The thrown
 * path needed the arm above. The `MAX_TOKENS` metadata path already worked end to end before this
 * node — `refusal.ts` reads camelCase `finishReason` off the same shelf — so the cells for it are
 * *pinning* what was measured, not covering something new.
 *
 * **VERTEX IS COVERED TOO, from bytes measured live on 2026-09-12 through the same package.** The
 * envelope is the one the package's code predicts — `BaseChatGoogle` reaches both platforms through
 * one `apiClient.fetch(...)` and one `throw await RequestError.fromResponse(response)`, and the only
 * platform branch is `buildUrl` — so the class, the status, the `data` body and the
 * `message = errorBody.error.message` derivation are shared. **The wording differs in the
 * parentheses and in nothing else:** AI Studio sends `... allowed (1048576).` where Vertex sends
 * `... allowed 1048576.` Both curated Vertex defaults answer that way on both transports, and the
 * one arm covers them because it matches the tail of the sentence.
 *
 * One Vertex case is *not* covered — `gemini-2.5-flash-image` while streaming, which answers with no
 * token-count prose at all. It is pinned below as a negative control, and that control is
 * **permanent**: [[EXT-176]] re-measured the case live on 2026-09-18, ruled it not worth closing, and
 * shipped nothing. The argument is at the seam, in `terminationReason.ts` beside the arm — read it
 * there before proposing a matcher that reaches into this cell.
 *
 * **How the fixtures are driven.** Each cell replaces `apiClient.fetch` on a real `ChatGoogle` with
 * one that answers from the recorded bytes, so the real `RequestError.fromResponse` builds the real
 * class and the real converters build the real message — the shape under test is the package's own,
 * not a hand-drawn imitation. No request is ever made: the api key is an explicit placeholder (so
 * the ambient `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is never read), and every cell that drives a fixture through the
 * model asserts the stub was called, which makes a stub that failed to install a red rather than a
 * live network call on a CI cell. The Vertex
 * cells use a second factory that is hermetic in two further respects, asserted rather than
 * described — see `vertexModel` and the construction cell beside it.

 * project and no location — a fixture labelled Vertex that came from a different endpoint, green on
 * a developer machine and differently shaped on a CI cell that has no key.

 * waits on the GCE metadata server before throwing `Unable to detect a Project Id in the current
