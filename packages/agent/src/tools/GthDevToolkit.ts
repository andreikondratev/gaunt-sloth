/**
 * Schema definitions for built-in tools.
 *
 * **[[EXT-125]] scope item 3, decided: the fixed `run_*` tools take the per-call budget too.**
 * Three reasons, in the order that decided it:
 *
 *  1. **The node's own worked example is a fixed tool.** `run_tests` is the likeliest command in
 *     any repo to want ten minutes. Shipping the appeal on `run_shell_command` alone would close
 *     the gap everywhere except the place it was most likely to be felt, and leave a model whose
 *     test suite was killed with the one move the node exists to remove: re-run it unchanged.
 *  2. **"The user configures the command, so the user owns its timeout" does not distinguish
 *     them.** `getShellTimeoutMs` reads ONE value — the `run_shell_command` registry entry's
 *     `timeout` — and it governs all five tools. Whatever authority that argument gives the user
 *     over `run_tests`, it gives identically over `run_shell_command`.
 *  3. **A budget grants strictly less on a fixed tool.** The model cannot choose what runs there;
 *     the command is the user's own string. The argument moves one bounded number, and
 *     {@link getShellMaxTimeoutMs} bounds it the same way on every tool, through the same seam in
 *     {@link GthDevToolkit.executeCommand} — there is no second code path to keep honest.
 *
 * **The rejected alternative, recorded so it is not silently re-adopted:** leave the three
 * no-argument schemas as `z.object({})` so the model supplies no input at all on the fixed-tool
 * path, on the ground that a path with zero model-authored input is a smaller attack surface than
 * one with a validated integer. Rejected because the surface it protects is not the dangerous one —
 * the command string is what makes `run_shell_command` sensitive, and that is user-authored here —
 * while the cost is leaving the node's motivating case unfixed. If that trade is ever re-argued,
 * re-argue it against reason 2, which is the load-bearing one.
 *
 * `run_single_test` gains `timeoutMs` and NOT a second string: `testPath` goes through
 * {@link GthDevToolkit.validateParameterValue} because it is interpolated into a shell command, and
 * a number that is only ever compared to a ceiling must never be routed through a string sanitizer.
