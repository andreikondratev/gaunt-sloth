 * for a call that WILL be executed this turn. But when replaying HISTORY, promoting a STALLED text
 * call (one the client recorded but that never ran) yields an `AIMessage` with `tool_calls` and NO
 * following `tool_result` — a shape a strict provider (Anthropic) 400s on, where the pre-EXT-35
 * plain text was valid. So promotion is allowed ONLY when the assistant message is immediately
 * followed by a `tool` result message; a dangling call stays plain text (`allowTextCallPromotion:
 * false`).
 *
 * RC-18 (backward, orphan-RESULT): the mirror image. A replayed `role:'tool'` message whose matching
 * `tool_call` id is absent from EVERY PRECEDING assistant message is an ORPHAN — converting it to a
 * `ToolMessage` yields a tool result with no preceding `AIMessage.tool_calls`, which the same strict
 * provider 400s on (`Invalid parameter: messages with role 'tool' must be a response to a preceding
 * message with 'tool_calls'`, INVALID_TOOL_RESULTS). Such orphans arise when a terminal
 * (`returnDirect`) tool call's result is reconstructed by the client without its parenting assistant
 * `tool_call`. We DROP the orphan (match on tool_call_id, NOT adjacency; keep genuine pairs; do NOT
 * fabricate a synthetic call — mirroring EXT-43's demote-don't-invent spirit). Ids are accumulated
 * in iteration order, so a result whose matching call appears only LATER is still an orphan.
 *
 * RC-32 (tool NAME restoration): the AG-UI wire message for a `tool` result carries `toolCallId`
 * but no tool name, so a naively-converted `ToolMessage` has none — and every middleware that
 * inspects results by name is blind to it. `frontend-image-injection` keys on
 * `msg.name === 'capture_image'`, so a captured photo reached the model on the resume turn (where
 * the graph builds the ToolMessage itself, with a name) and then vanished from every later turn,
 * leaving the model to answer questions about a picture it could no longer see. The name is
 * recoverable from the parenting assistant `tool_call`, which this function already walks for the
 * RC-18 guard, so it is resolved there and stamped back on.

 * port (`listen(NaN)` binds an arbitrary port, where a host node cannot resolve raises on the
 * `error` event and is rejected below), and any list of accepted literals would refuse `::`, a
 * specific interface address, or a hostname — all legitimate. An **empty** host is the one value
 * that is rewritten, because `listen` treats it as falsy and binds the wildcard, which is the
 * opposite of anything an empty value could have meant.
 *
 * `corsOrigin` is the browser origin allowed to call this server, and it takes the same shape of
 * precedence: the argument (the caller's `--cors-origin` flag), then `commands.api.cors.allowOrigin`,
 * then the default below. It is resolved here rather than at either CLI door for the reason
 * {@link DEFAULT_AGUI_HOST} gives about the host — one definition, reached by both doors and by a
 * programmatic caller alike.
 *
 * **Why an argument at all**, when the header value is already a config key: the port and the origin
 * are one decision. Whatever moves the web client — a per-worktree port allocation, a second client
 * on the same machine, a `WEB_PORT` in a `.env` — changes its origin at the same moment, and a
 * config file cannot be rewritten by the thing that computed the port. Without the override the
 * client relocates and every request it makes is then refused by a preflight still naming the origin
 * it no longer has (OPS-16).
 *
 * **Singular**, matching the config key it overrides rather than the ADK server's plural
 * `--adk.web.cors.origins`: that server matches an incoming origin against a list and echoes the one
 * that matched, while this one sets the header verbatim, and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` carries
 * exactly one origin. A list here would produce a header no browser accepts.
 *
 * A **blank** origin falls through to the config rather than being sent, because an empty
 * `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` matches nothing and would block every browser client — the opposite
 * of what supplying the flag can have meant. That is the same reasoning as the empty host above and
 * the opposite outcome, since there the empty value had a live meaning to `listen` worth overriding.
 *
 * Resolves with the bound `http.Server` once it is listening: the one handle that says which port a
 * `port: 0` request actually got, and the one way to stop the server. The CLI door ignores it.

      // fulfil — the encoder below would forward it as a `TOOL_CALL_RESULT`, and the client would
      // hold a failed result for the tool it is about to run. That alone breaks client tools.
      // (2) It drains pending approval interrupts through the runner's own gate, which DECIDES them
      // (bypass → allow-list → rater → a human callback that defaults to reject); this server
      // leaves such a graph parked, and changing that is a decision about approvals, not about
      // overflow. (3) It drives one runner-owned thread, where this handler rotates a checkpoint
      // thread per fresh run and pins the suspended one for a resume — and it has no entry point
      // for a client resume at all (`streamWithEventsResume` with the client's value and queued
      // messages). Routing would mean a runner per toolset, a per-request thread API and a new
      // resume driver: three new runner surfaces to reach one seam, plus a semantic fork in the
      // driver for (1).
      //
      // A SEAM OF THIS SERVER'S OWN — catch, classify, compact, retry written a third time — was
      // rejected for the reason EXT-167 gave when it made both runner drivers call one function:
      // three copies of a decision drift.

      // one is that neither caller holds a copy to edit, and a spec on each side pins that the
      // shared loop is what it reaches.
