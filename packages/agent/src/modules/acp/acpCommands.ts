/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 * [[EXT-142]] — **the commands an ACP client can run in a session**, and the one command there is
 * today: the escape hatch for a refusal the user saved from the editor.
 *
 * ## Why this exists at all
 *
 * [[EXT-107]] made *Reject and remember* write to the project's deny file, and wired it on both ACP
 * dialects as well as the terminal. The control that LIFTS a saved refusal was wired on the
 * terminal only, so a refusal made in an editor was permanent from inside that editor: the only
 * ways back were to open a terminal session or to hand-edit a file the user had never been told
 * about. Those are exactly the two answers [[EXT-107]] rules out, and the reasoning does not stop
 * being true because the client speaks ACP.
 *
 * ## The protocol already has the affordance
 *
 * `available_commands_update` is a `session/update` the agent sends the client, in **both**
 * dialects (measured in `@agentclientprotocol/sdk@1.4.0`: the v1 and v2 `SessionUpdate` unions each
 * carry an `AvailableCommandsUpdate` member). The client renders it in its own command UI, so the
 * command is discoverable with its description and the user never has to learn that a file exists.
 * That is what a `_gsloth/*` `_meta` extension could not have done: `_meta` is for things the
 * protocol has no shape for, and a custom method would be invisible in the one client this is about.
 *
 * **Neither dialect gates it behind a capability.** `AgentCapabilities` / `SessionCapabilities` name
 * nothing command-related in either schema, so advertising is unconditional and the agent's
 * `initialize` response does not have to claim anything new.
 *
 * ## How a command comes back
 *
 * There is no invoke method. `PromptRequest` carries `sessionId` and `prompt` and nothing else in
 * either dialect, so a client runs an advertised command by sending it as prompt text and the agent
 * parses the leading name. {@link parseAcpSessionCommand} is that parse, and it is what keeps a
 * command off the model's turn.
 *
 * **The leading slash is a client CONVENTION, and it is the one thing here the schema does not
 * settle.** The schema says only that the input is *"all text that was typed after the command
 * name"*, and the SDK ships nothing on the client side that builds a prompt from an
 * `AvailableCommand` — so what arrives is whatever the client composes, and `/name args` is what
 * ACP's own documentation and Zed use. The parse requires the slash because the alternative is
 * worse: matching a bare leading word would intercept an ordinary message that happens to start
 * with it. **If a client's advertised command ever does nothing, this is the first place to look**
 * — the failure is safe (the text goes to the model) but it is silent, and no in-process test can
 * see it, because the harness sends what the test typed rather than what a real client composes.
 *
 * `maintenance/ux-guidelines.md`: **DL-5** — the affordance is the host protocol's own, so the
 * client draws it the way it draws every other command, rather than a private extension only a
 * client we control could see. **DL-4** — a refusal the user cannot inspect or reverse is the
 * opposite of inspectable. **DL-6** — what it lists is the shared refusal notice, with the same
 * three origin words the terminal uses, so one refusal does not mean two things across surfaces.
 *
 * ## What `/approvals` renders here, and what it deliberately does not
 *
 * The terminal's `/approvals` prints the posture notice (the current mode, the four modes it could
 * be switched to, the docs pointer, the MCP-trust usage line) and then the refusal list. **This
 * surface prints the refusal list alone.** Not an oversight and not a smaller budget: the posture
 * notice's copy names controls this surface does not offer — `/approvals <mode>` and
 * `/approvals trust` — and printing a control that is then refused is the failure the whole
 * approvals copy is written to avoid. The refusal list is the thing this node is about, and every
 * line of it is true here.
 *
 * ## One entry, and room for a second
 *
 * The registry is a list because a second command will want the same wiring, and the payload
 * builder, the parse and the dispatch are already general over it. What is deliberately NOT here is
 * the rest of the terminal's slash-command set: compaction, history, reasoning and debug are a
 * separate surface with their own questions, and porting them would have made this change about the
 * bridge instead of about the defect.
