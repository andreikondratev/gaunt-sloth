/**
 * @packageDocumentation
 * Middleware to inject binary content (images, PDFs, audio) as HumanMessage.
 *
 * The gth_read_binary tool returns binary data as a special string format:
 * gth_read_binary;type:${type};path:${encodedPath};data:${media_type};base64,${data}
 * where path is URL-encoded to handle special characters like semicolons.
 *
 * This middleware:
 * 1. Detects the gth_read_binary tool calls
 * 2. Parses the special string format from ToolMessage content
 * 3. Adds a HumanMessage carrying the binary content block to the model call that follows the tool
 *    result — to that REQUEST only, never to the conversation (the `wrapModelCall` hook below)
 * 4. Refuses a format type no provider can receive at all (see {@link isDeliverableFormatType}),
 *    and a non-image attachment bound for a provider measured to discard it silently
 *    (see {@link nonImageBinaryFateFor})
 * 5. Says, in the user's terms, that an attachment rode a request the provider rejected, and that
 *    the conversation is unaffected (see `noteRejectedAttachment`)
 *
 * This works around LangChain's limitation where ToolMessage doesn't properly
 * support binary content blocks for most providers.

/**
 * The measured fate of a non-image binary block, per provider label.
 *
 * **Measured CFG-63, not inferred.** Every arm below comes from handing the installed client the
 * exact block `createContentBlock` emits, with `globalThis.fetch` replaced by a capture stub
 * (no network, no vendor calls), and reading either the thrown error or the request body that was
 * built. The value is the same for `file`, `audio`, `video` and `binary`, because what separates the
 * arms is whether the converter has a branch for the block at all — not which format it carries.
 *
 * - `xai-responses` → **silently-discarded**. `@langchain/xai@1.4.10`
 *   `dist/converters/responses.js:30-33` — the human-message branch recognises `text` and
 *   `image_url` and returns `{ type:'input_text', text:'' }` for everything else. The probe against
 *   `https://api.x.ai/v1/responses` built a body carrying no trace of the base64 payload for all
 *   four format types. There is no shape that would work instead: xAI's Responses union offers only
 *   `input_file` carrying a Files-API `file_id`, and gth has no upload path to produce one.
 * - `anthropic` → delivered-or-loud. `@langchain/anthropic@1.5.8` `dist/utils/content.js:78`
 *   (`fromStandardFileBlock`) converts a PDF to a `document` block; a non-PDF non-image mime throws
 *   `Unsupported file mime type for file base64 source`, audio throws
 *   `Converter for anthropic does not implement fromStandardAudioBlock method`, and video/binary
 *   throw from `@langchain/core`'s dispatcher.
 * - `openai`, `openrouter`, `deepseek`, `xai`, `huggingface` → delivered-or-loud. All reach
 *   `@langchain/openai@1.5.10` `dist/converters/completions.js:72` (`fromStandardFileBlock` → a
 *   `file` part carrying `file_data`) and `:34` (`fromStandardAudioBlock` → `input_audio` for
 *   wav/mp3, a throw otherwise). `openai` on the Responses path (GS2-74) converts a file at
 *   `dist/converters/responses.js:1081-1097` into `input_file` instead; both wire paths deliver it.
 * - `google-genai`, `vertexai`, `google` → delivered-or-loud. `@langchain/google@0.2.3`
 *   `dist/converters/messages.js:80` and `:49` turn file and audio into `inlineData`; video and
 *   binary throw from the dispatcher.
 * - `ollama` → delivered-or-loud. `@langchain/ollama@1.3.0` `dist/utils.js:92` throws
 *   `Unsupported content type: <type>` for every non-`text`/`image_url` part.
 * - `groq` → delivered-or-loud, and this is the one arm measured on the SERVER rather than the
 *   client. `@langchain/groq@1.3.1` `dist/chat_models.js:82` assigns `content: message.content`
 *   verbatim, so the block reaches the wire unchanged and only Groq's API can decide. Measured live
 *   2026-09-08 against `qwen/qwen3.8-27b` with a PDF: the API **rejects** it — HTTP 400
 *   `invalid_request_error`, naming the content-part types it accepts, `text` / `image_url` /
 *   `document`. The user reads that error, so nothing is discarded and nothing is refused here.
 *   **Note what the rejection also reveals:** Groq has a `document` part type, and gth emits the
 *   standard block's `file`, which is not one of the three — so a shape Groq would accept plausibly
 *   exists and gth does not build it. Whether any Groq model then *reads* a `document` is a separate
 *   question and is NOT established; do not treat the accepted type as a working feature.
 *
 * Everything else is `unmeasured`, and like {@link imageBlockFor}'s fallback arm it must stay
 * permissive. Who lands there, precisely: any label this switch does not enumerate — a custom or
 * `fake` provider, a future vendor package, a LangChain class whose `_llmType()` nobody has measured
 * — plus the empty string, which `resolveVisionProvider` yields only when there is no `llm` or its
 * `_llmType()` is missing or throws. (A module config supplying an already-built LLM does NOT
 * generally give `''`: `modelProviderType` is unset there, so the `_llmType()` fallback runs and
 * returns that class's own label — which is exactly how `xai-responses` arrives above.) Refusing on
 * a label nobody has measured would break configurations that work today, so this leaves a
 * `debugLog` trace instead and an unenumerated label is discoverable in a `/debug-dump`.
 *
 * Exported so each arm can be unit-tested directly.

/**
 * The `gth_read_binary` results this model call is the direct continuation of: the trailing run of

 *
 * **The window is the fix, not a tidy-up.** Scanning a fixed number of recent messages instead
 * re-matches the same tool result on the NEXT turn, when the user has typed something unrelated and
 * the ToolMessage has not yet aged out — so the attachment is rebuilt and re-sent on a request that
 * has nothing to do with it. A provider that rejects the block then rejects every one of those
 * turns too, which is the whole session-killing shape [[CFG-69]] exists to remove; scoping the
 * injection by state alone would leave that half standing. Stopping at the first non-tool message
 * also keeps the multi-attachment case intact: parallel `gth_read_binary` calls in one step land as
 * adjacent ToolMessages and are all collected.
 *
 * `isToolMessage` rather than `instanceof ToolMessage`: the predicate is class-identity free, so a
 * second `@langchain/core` copy in a consumer's tree cannot make a real tool result look like the
 * end of the run and silently drop the attachment.
 *
 * **CFG-72 — a message a sibling middleware appended in this step is stepped over, not treated as
 * the end of the run.** "The model call that directly follows tool execution" is a claim about the
 * graph, and the graph interposes every `beforeModel` hook between the tools node and this one: the
 * tools node routes back to the FIRST `beforeModel` node, the chain ends at the agent node, and the
 * agent node builds its request from the state those nodes have already committed. So a sibling that
 * appends — `frontendImageInjectionMiddleware` puts the captured frame on the end — leaves a
 * HumanMessage sitting on the trailing tool run, the walk-back stops on it, and the attachment is
 * never collected. Measured on the real graph, same scenario: 0 blocks reach the model with the
 * sibling active, 1 without it. It needs no same-step coincidence, because that middleware's
 * idempotency guard is keyed on the graph THREAD — a replayed history re-injects a capture from
 * several messages back, at the tail.
 *
 * **Why the mark and not a wider window.** The shadow case and the case [[CFG-69]] closed are the
 * same shape in state: a tool round with a HumanMessage on the end of it. One must attach and the
 * other must not, so no rule reading message adjacency alone can separate them — measured both ways
 * here, where restoring the five-message window turns the shadow cells green and the CFG-69
 * session-survival pin red. What actually differs is PROVENANCE, so provenance is what is recorded:
 * a middleware marks what it appends to state (`markMiddlewareInjected`, in
 * `middlewareInjectedMarker.ts`, which carries why the mark is plain data on the message rather than
 * object identity) and adjacency reasoning steps over it. Narrowness is the safeguard — only a
 * MARKED message is skipped, so a real user message still ends the walk exactly as CFG-69 left it.
 *
 * **Rejected: collecting earlier in the pipeline** (a `beforeModel` of our own, or a stash filled
 * when the tool runs). Ordering against a sibling's `beforeModel` node is decided by the order the
 * middleware array happens to be in, which is the fragility this node is about; and a stash keyed on
 * tool execution drops the attachment on any path where the model call is not in the same process as
 * the tool call — a resumed or replayed run — while removing the window that CFG-69's control
 * mutation needs in order to still mean something.
 *
 * **The residual, accepted deliberately:** a middleware that appends in `beforeModel` without
 * marking still shadows. Every middleware gth ships marks; a user's own JS-config middleware can
 * (the marker is exported), and one that does not fails the way it does today — the attachment is
 * absent, never corrupted, and nothing reaches history. Closing that would mean dropping adjacency
 * altogether, which costs more than it buys.

 * Say what happened to the person watching, when a request carrying an attachment is rejected.

 * (`messages.4.content.1`) that names neither the file nor the provider, and says nothing about
 * whether the conversation is still usable. That last part is the question they actually have, and
 * since the injection is request-scoped the answer is a definite yes.
 *
 * **Only a rejection of the request itself is annotated**, decided by the shared classifier rather
 * than by a second opinion about error prose: a dropped connection or a rate limit on a turn that
 * happened to carry an attachment is not about the attachment, and a note claiming otherwise would
 * send the user chasing the wrong thing. The claims made are true even when the attachment was not
 * what the provider objected to — the request did carry it, and it is not in the conversation.
 *
 * The original error is annotated and rethrown rather than replaced, so its status, name and cause
 * survive for anyone reading it.
 *
 * **The classification is committed as a VALUE before the text is touched, and that is not a
 * nicety.** For an error nobody has classified yet, `classifyThrownTermination` substring-matches
 * the text, and its timeout, network, auth, rate-limit and context-overflow arms are all tried
 * BEFORE the invalid-request one — so a note is not inert prose, it is input to the classifier this
 * function itself calls one line earlier. The note carries a **filename**, which is user data nobody
 * here controls: `api-timeout-investigation.pdf` reads back as a timeout, `contract - terminated.pdf`
 * as a dropped connection, `forbidden-zones.pdf` as an auth failure. The user would then be told to
 * retry a request that can never succeed, and a name matching the overflow arm would send the runner
 * off to compact the history and try again.
 *
 * Sanitising the filename would be an enumeration of today's pattern lists — it would go quietly
 * stale the next time one grows. So the fix is the rule this module already states: the prose is
 * never the carrier. Classify first, commit the value, and only then write the note — after which
 * (CFG-73) the classifier declines to read the message at all, so no reader downstream can be moved
 * by what the file is called.
 *
 * Fail-soft in both directions: a non-Error throw and an unwritable `message` leave the failure
 * exactly as it arrived, because explaining one must never become a second one.
